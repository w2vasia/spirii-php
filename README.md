# 🧪 Backend Developer Challenge – Laravel 10 Boilerplate

Welcome! This is the starting point for your backend coding challenge. It includes a basic Laravel 10 setup with a `users` table and a `transactions` table. Your job is to implement the logic described below using best practices and clear code structure.

## 🧠 Objective

You are building part of a game system where users can earn, spend, and request payouts using an in-game currency (1 SCR = 1 EUR). Your job is to implement endpoints that provide a summary of users’ transactions and allow them to request payouts.

The application will handle **millions of requests per day**, so your solution should consider performance, caching, and scalability.
